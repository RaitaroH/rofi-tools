# rofi tools

The rofi/dmenu scripts I use. Edit is required for personal use because I removed my personal folders and alike.

## dCheat

Requires `pip install cheat`. See any cheats you have in vim.

## dKill

Kill anything. Also doubles as a quick htop thingy.

## dLinks

Handle different kinds of operations on links. You will need:

```
pip install youtube-dl
pip instlal bandcamp-dl
pip install gallery-dl
```

## dMoji

Get emojis from a file. Unicode emojis, japanese style emojis are present. Not everything.

## dMusic
